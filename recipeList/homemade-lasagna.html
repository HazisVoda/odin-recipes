        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, 
            made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. 
            A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta 
            but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. 
            I have found none better anywhere. 
            Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.

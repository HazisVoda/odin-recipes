        <ol>
            <li>
                Mix the dry ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, 
                baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix the wet ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, 
                eggs, and melted butter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine the wet and dry ingredients: Pour the wet ingredients into the dry 
                ingredients and stir until just combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook the pancakes: Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat. 
                Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle for each pancake. Cook until bubbles 
                form on the surface, then flip and cook until browned on the other side.
